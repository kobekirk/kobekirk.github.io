Hi everyone, I'm Kobe. I am a senior Quantitative Economics major at St. Olaf College, with concentrations in both Statistics and Data Science and Management Studies. I'm passionate about data analysis and drawing conclusions from data. I play basketball at St. Olaf, but I love all sports, and outside of my studies and sports I enjoy fishing and golfing.

## Education

- **BA in Quantitative Economics**, St. Olaf College
- Concentrations: Statistics & Data Science; Management Studies
- Expected graduation May 2026
