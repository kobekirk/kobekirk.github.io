Oh well.\nGoing into this project, I was well aware of the high amount of cuss words used in Pulp Fiction. What I didn’t know was that 2.3% of all words in the entire movie were cuss words. I also didn’t know that Marsellus had almost 6% of his entire dialogue being cuss words, or that Jules used over twice as many cuss words as the next highest character. Those are just a few of the conclusions I was able to draw through my analysis of the Pulp Fiction script."
