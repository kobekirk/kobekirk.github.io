    "text": "Pulp Fiction (1994) is an American crime film written and directed by renowned filmmaker Quentin Tarantino, starring John Travolta, Samuel L. Jackson, and Uma Thurman, among other notable actors. Set in Los Angeles, the movie portrays four intertwining stories of crime and violence. The film won Best Original Screenplay at the 67th Academy Awards, and received a Rotten Tomatoes score of 92%. It is important to note that Tarantino is well-known for his profound use of cuss words in his films, and specifically Pulp Fiction."

Oh well.\nGoing into this project, I was well aware of the high amount of cuss words used in Pulp Fiction. What I didn’t know was that 2.3% of all words in the entire movie were cuss words. I also didn’t know that Marsellus had almost 6% of his entire dialogue being cuss words, or that Jules used over twice as many cuss words as the next highest character. Those are just a few of the conclusions I was able to draw through my analysis of the Pulp Fiction script."
